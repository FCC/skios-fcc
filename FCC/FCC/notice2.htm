        <p>
        <font size=3>The data we collect is helpful for consumers, the FCC, and others interested in understanding
            mobile broadband in the United States.
        </font>
        </p>
        <p>
        <font size=3>We share your mobile broadband performance information in four ways.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Internally</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </font>
        </p>
        <p>
        <font size=3>We may share your mobile broadband performance information within the FCC to write our Measuring
            Broadband America Report on Mobile Performance and to support our developement of broadband policy.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Third-Party Partners Who Help Us Run Our Test and Support Our Program</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </font>
        </p>
        <p>
        <font size=3>We may share your mobile broadband performance information with <a href="inapp://msg_0">our contractor</a> who manages the measurement
            program, with <a href="inapp://msg_1">partners who support the program and architecture</a>, and with <a href="inapp://msg_2">partners supporting our analysis or contributing peer reviews</a>.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Available to the Public</strong></li>

        <p>
        <font size=3>We plan to publish averages and other aggregated statistics that describe important features of mobile broadband performance. These highly aggregated statistics pose very low risks to your privacy.
        </font>
        </p>
        <p><font size=4><strong><u>Processed Coarsened Raw Data</u></strong></font></p>
        <p>
        <font size=3>We plan to publish only the anonymous data in a processed and coarsened form that supports the averages and other statistics that we publish in our reports.  Prior to release of this data, <a href="inapp://msg_3">the FCC and researchers</a> skilled in the field of statistics and computer science will identify patterns in the raw data that could be exploited to compromise your privacy.  If we find concerns, we will take steps to address the risks by making the time, location or other information less specific, limiting the combinations of information we release, or deleting information.
